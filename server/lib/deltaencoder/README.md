# Delta Encoder Text Compression Module

This module allows for text to be compressed and decompressed with an algorithm known as delta encoding.

# Installation

Packages will be installed automatically by the parent package post-install script, but can also be installed with:
```npm i```

The module is included with the text compression microservice and there are in fact no required packages, for the time being.

# Testing (TODO)

Install Mocha globally:
```npm install -g mocha```

Unit test can be ran specifically for this module with:
```npm test```
